
This Document will outline the YouTube Tutorial Step-by-Step
-------------------------------------------------------------

1) Visit the GDELT Downloads Page and Select you CAMEO Data: https://www.gdeltproject.org/#downloading

1a) Download data based on date and time of your area of interest and save your .csv files from the GDELT Project

1b) This .csv data is not easily parsed-up by regular interpreters like excel or notepad++
	-That's because GDELT strongly encourages the user to use Google Big Query to download and analyze their data
	-Google Big Query Costs Money and the GDELT data does not provide nodes and edges for actual network analysis
	-For this reason, we will need to IMPORT our files into Google Sheets, then use the split text to columns feature
	-The way GDELT formats their .csv files makes the split text to columns function on other interpreters not work well with the .csv data



-------------------------------------------------------------

2) Import your downloaded .csv files into Google Sheets

2a) Highlight and select all of column A 

2b) Then go to the data tab and select split tect to columns feature
	-leave the setting as deafault, as this allows google to interpret the GDELT format 

2c) Download your parsed spreadsheets as .csv files 
	-in the next section, we will use the python script to concatenate and add fields to your GDELT data
-------------------------------------------------------------

3) Rename your .csv files that you just parsed in your folder in a numerically formatted order
	-for instance you can call your files GDELT_Cleaned_1, GDELT_Cleaned_2, GDELT_Cleaned_3 ....
	-This will allow us to concactenate large sums of GDELT data and assign a header to the concactenated table

3a) Set your paths to your machine's configuration and where you stored your parsed GDELT data

3b) Set your paths for exporting dataframes to csv arguments to your desired folder 
-------------------------------------------------------------

4) Geocode Accordingly 

4a) Geodessy is important and you want to pick a CRS,PCS that preserves shape (i.e. WGS84, Web Mercator) 
	-This will ensure that your data is being geocoded in coordinate system that is friendly to both network analysis and geocoding
