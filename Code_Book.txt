				GENERAL CAMEO Information
  **Note- Your Table May Omit Some of These Attributes Depending on the Year you Downloaded Them From**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-GlobalEventID:
 (integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely
identifies it in the master dataset. NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is
NOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields
should be used for this. NOTE: There appear to be a very small number of records that received
duplicate GLOBALEVENTID values due to an unknown error in the numbering subsystem early
on. This did not affect the deduplication process, since that operates directly on the attribute
fields themselves, but does appear to have led to some duplicate GlobalEventIDs. These appear
to be randomly distributed and the duplicate events should be safe to discard or renumber.

-Day:
 (integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.

-MonthYear (integer):
 Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format.

-Year (integer):
 Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format.

-FractionDate (numeric):
 Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF,
where FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day. This collapses the month and 
day into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year. The fractional
component (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365. This is an approximation and does
not correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but
offers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the
rough temporal distance between dates.

				Actor 1 Information 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Actor1Code (character or factor):
 The complete raw CAMEO code for Actor1 (includes
geographic, class, ethnic, religious, and type classes). May be blank if the system was unable to
identify an Actor1.

-Actor1Name (character):
 The actual name of the Actor 1. In the case of a political leader or
organization, this will be the leader’s formal name (GEORGE W BUSH, UNITED NATIONS), for a
geographic match it will be either the country or capital/major city name (UNITED STATES /
PARIS), and for ethnic, religious, and type matches it will reflect the root match class (KURD,
CATHOLIC, POLICE OFFICER, etc). May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1.

-Actor1CountryCode (character or factor): 
 The 3-character CAMEO code for the country
affiliation of Actor1. May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1 or determine
its country affiliation (such as “UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN”). Note that through 8/26/2013
matches for South Sudan (“SSD”) may be missing from this field. The country code will be
correctly present in the raw CAMEO code in Actor1Code, but may not have been correctly
placed into the Actor1CountryCode field – only South Sudan was affected by this issue.

-Actor1KnownGroupCode (character or factor): 
 If Actor1 is a known IGO/NGO/rebel organization
(United Nations, World Bank, al-Qaeda, etc) with its own CAMEO code, this field will contain
that code.

-Actor1EthnicCode (character or factor):
 If the source document specifies the ethnic affiliation
of Actor1 and that ethnic group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here. NOTE: a
few special groups like ARAB may also have entries in the type column due to legacy CAMEO
behavior. NOTE: this behavior is brand-new and highly experimental and may not capture all
affiliations properly.

-Actor1Religion1Code (character or factor):
 If the source document specifies the religious
affiliation of Actor1 and that religious group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered
here. NOTE: a few special groups like JEW may also have entries in the geographic or type
columns due to legacy CAMEO behavior. NOTE: this behavior is brand-new and highly
experimental and may not capture all affiliations properly.

-Actor1Religion2Code (character or factor):
 If multiple religious codes are specified for Actor1,
this contains the secondary code. Some religion entries automatically use two codes, such as
Catholic, which invokes Christianity as Code1 and Catholicism as Code2.

-Actor1Type1Code (character or factor): 
 The 3-character CAMEO code of the CAMEO “type” or
 “role” of Actor1, if specified. This can be a specific role such as Police Forces, Government,
 Military, Political Opposition, Rebels, etc, a broad role class such as Education, Elites, Media,
 Refugees, or organizational classes like Non-Governmental Movement. Special codes such as
 Moderate and Radical may refer to the operational strategy of a group.

-Actor1Type2Code (character or factor):
 If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this
returns the second code.

-Actor1Type3Code (character or factor):
 If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this
returns the third code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


				Actor 2 Information 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Actor2Code (character or factor):
 The complete raw CAMEO code for Actor1 (includes
geographic, class, ethnic, religious, and type classes). May be blank if the system was unable to
identify an Actor1.

-Actor2Name (character):
 The actual name of the Actor 1. In the case of a political leader or
organization, this will be the leader’s formal name (GEORGE W BUSH, UNITED NATIONS), for a
geographic match it will be either the country or capital/major city name (UNITED STATES /
PARIS), and for ethnic, religious, and type matches it will reflect the root match class (KURD,
CATHOLIC, POLICE OFFICER, etc). May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1.

-Actor2CountryCode (character or factor): 
 The 3-character CAMEO code for the country
affiliation of Actor1. May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1 or determine
its country affiliation (such as “UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN”). Note that through 8/26/2013
matches for South Sudan (“SSD”) may be missing from this field. The country code will be
correctly present in the raw CAMEO code in Actor1Code, but may not have been correctly
placed into the Actor1CountryCode field – only South Sudan was affected by this issue.

-Actor2KnownGroupCode (character or factor): 
 If Actor1 is a known IGO/NGO/rebel organization
(United Nations, World Bank, al-Qaeda, etc) with its own CAMEO code, this field will contain
that code.

-Actor2EthnicCode (character or factor):
 If the source document specifies the ethnic affiliation
of Actor1 and that ethnic group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here. NOTE: a
few special groups like ARAB may also have entries in the type column due to legacy CAMEO
behavior. NOTE: this behavior is brand-new and highly experimental and may not capture all
affiliations properly.

-Actor2Religion1Code (character or factor):
 If the source document specifies the religious
affiliation of Actor1 and that religious group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered
here. NOTE: a few special groups like JEW may also have entries in the geographic or type
columns due to legacy CAMEO behavior. NOTE: this behavior is brand-new and highly
experimental and may not capture all affiliations properly.

-Actor2Religion2Code (character or factor):
 If multiple religious codes are specified for Actor1,
this contains the secondary code. Some religion entries automatically use two codes, such as
Catholic, which invokes Christianity as Code1 and Catholicism as Code2.

-Actor2Type1Code (character or factor): 
 The 3-character CAMEO code of the CAMEO “type” or
 “role” of Actor1, if specified. This can be a specific role such as Police Forces, Government,
 Military, Political Opposition, Rebels, etc, a broad role class such as Education, Elites, Media,
 Refugees, or organizational classes like Non-Governmental Movement. Special codes such as
 Moderate and Radical may refer to the operational strategy of a group.

-Actor2Type2Code (character or factor):
 If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this
returns the second code.

-Actor2Type3Code (character or factor):
 If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this
returns the third code.

				Event Action Attributes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-IsRootEvent (logical or binary or byte): 
  The system codes every event found in an entire
document, using an array of techniques to deference and link information together. A number
of previous projects such as the ICEWS initiative have found that events occurring in the lead
paragraph of a document tend to be the most “important.” This flag can therefore be used as a
proxy for the rough importance of an event to create subsets of the event stream.

-EventCode (character or factor):
 This is the raw CAMEO action code describing the action that
Actor1 performed upon Actor2.

-EventBaseCode (character or factor): CAMEO event codes are defined in a three-level
taxonomy. For events at level three in the taxonomy, this yields its level two leaf root node. For
example, code “0251” (“Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions”) would yield an
EventBaseCode of “025” (“Appeal to yield”). This makes it possible to aggregate events at 
various resolutions of specificity. For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to
EventCode.

-EventRootCode (character or factor): Similar to EventBaseCode, this defines the root-level
category the event code falls under. For example, code “0251” (“Appeal for easing of
administrative sanctions”) has a root code of “02” (“Appeal”). This makes it possible to
aggregate events at various resolutions of specificity. For events at levels two or one, this field
will be set to EventCode.

-QuadClass (integer): The entire CAMEO event taxonomy is ultimately organized under four
primary classifications: Verbal Cooperation, Material Cooperation, Verbal Conflict, and Material
Conflict. This field specifies this primary classification for the event type, allowing analysis at the
highest level of aggregation. The numeric codes in this field map to the Quad Classes as follows:
1=Verbal Cooperation, 2=Material Cooperation, 3=Verbal Conflict, 4=Material Conflict.

-GoldsteinScale (numeric):
 Each CAMEO event code is assigned a numeric score from -10 to +10,
capturing the theoretical potential impact that type of event will have on the stability of a
country. This is known as the Goldstein Scale. This field specifies the Goldstein score for each
event type. NOTE: this score is based on the type of event, not the specifics of the actual event
record being recorded – thus two riots, one with 10 people and one with 10,000, will both
receive the same Goldstein score. This can be aggregated to various levels of time resolution to
yield an approximation of the stability of a location over time.

-NumMentions (integer):
 This is the total number of mentions of this event across all source
documents. Multiple references to an event within a single document also contribute to this
count. This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more
discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant. The total universe of source
documents and the density of events within them vary over time, so it is recommended that this
field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time
period of interest. NOTE: this field is updated over time if news articles published later discuss
this event (for example, in the weeks after a major bombing there will likely be numerous news
articles published mentioning the original bombing as context to new developments, while on
the one-year anniversary there will likely be further coverage). At this time the daily event
stream only includes new event records found each day and does not include these updates; a
special “updates” stream will be released in Fall 2013 that will include these.

-NumSources (integer): This is the total number of information sources containing one or more
mentions of this event. This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event:
the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant. The total universe of
sources varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or
other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest. NOTE: same as with
NumMentions, this field is updated over time to reflect subsequent coverage of the event.
Similarly, these updates are not included in the daily event stream, but will be incorporated into
a new “updates” stream to be released in Fall 2013.

-NumArticles (integer): This is the total number of source documents containing one or more
mentions of this event. This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event:
the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant. The total universe of
source documents varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the
average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest. NOTE:
same as with NumMentions, this field is updated over time to reflect subsequent coverage of
the event, but these updates are not currently part of the daily event stream.

-AvgTone. (numeric):
 This is the average “tone” of all documents containing one or more
mentions of this event. The score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely
positive). Common values range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral. This can be
used as a method of filtering the “context” of events as a subtle measure of the importance of
an event and as a proxy for the “impact” of that event. For example, a riot event with a slightly
negative average tone is likely to have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely
negative average tone, it suggests a far more serious occurrence. A riot with a positive score
likely suggests a very minor occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative
(such as a report of an attack occurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in
a country and how the number of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).

					EVENT GEOGRAPHY
  **Note- Event Geography Coordinates may be geocoded, but can hinder a social network analysis between actors**
  ***In the table you produce with the code provided, you will know your data is event geography data because it is marked with an '_extra' at the end of the attribute***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Actor1Geo_Type (integer):
 This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type and
holds one of the following values: 1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), 2=USSTATE
(match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), 4=WORLDCITY
(match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE (match was to an
Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US state). This can be used to
filter events by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those events with a
landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping. Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY),
2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the
centroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will be blank.

-Actor1Geo_Fullname (character):
 This is the full human-readable name of the matched
location. In the case of a country it is simply the country name. For US and World states it is in
the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of
“City/Landmark, State, Country”. This can be used to label locations when placing events on a
map. NOTE: this field reflects the precise name used to refer to the location in the text itself,
meaning it may contain multiple spellings of the same location – use the FeatureID column to
determine whether two location names refer to the same place.

-Actor1Geo_CountryCode (character):
 This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the
location.

-Actor1Geo_ADM1Code (character):
 This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by
the 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative division
housing the landmark. In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character shortform of the
state’s name (such as “TX” for Texas).

-Actor1Geo_Lat (numeric):
 This is the centroid latitude of the landmark for mapping.

-Actor1Geo_Long (numeric):
 This is the centroid longitude of the landmark for mapping.

-Actor1Geo_FeatureID (signed integer):
 This is the GNS or GNIS FeatureID for this location.
More information on these values can be found in Leetaru (2012).
5 NOTE: This field will be blank
except when Actor1Geo_Type has a value of 3 or 4. A small percentage of small cities and
towns may have a blank value in this field even for Actor1Geo_Type values of 3 or 4: this will be
corrected in the 2.0 release of GDELT. NOTE: This field can contain both positive and negative
numbers, see Leetaru(2012) for more information on this.

					Source Fields
`      **Note- Some Urls may now be dead because of the year produced and other factors**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-DATEADDED (integer):
 This field stores the date the event was added to the master database.

-SOURCEURL (character): This field is only present in the daily event stream files beginning April
1, 2013 and lists the URL of the news article the event was found in. If the event was found in
an article from the BBC Monitoring service, this field will contain “BBC Monitoring.” If an event
was mentioned in multiple articles, only one of the URLs is provided. This field is not present in
event files prior to April 1, 2013.
